This open source C++ library supports playing Diablo II on closed Battle.net servers using a pair of classic/expansion keys and a character on a Diablo II account. It offers a minimalistic client interface from which own classes can be derived so it can react to game server packets.

It uses the ['nil' general purpose library](http://code.google.com/p/libnil/).
